This data is based on Social Security registration versus birth records so it does not represent the full data set of names but it does give us an interesting view of peoples names in US history.
Based on this data 30274 names have been used in the US, keep in mind spelling differences are treated as unique names.

	select distinct name
	from stateNames

Of these 2896 are gender agnostic names

	create table statenameGender
	as select distinct name, gender
	from stateNames

	select name, count(gender)
	from statenameGender
	group by name
	having count(gender) >1

Looking looking at the data from 1910-1914 and comparing the names list to 2010-2014 there are some interesting details
Ethel was the most common name name used between 1910-2014 that does not show up between 2010-2014.  Ethel might have been popularized by Ethel Barrymore who was a famous movie star (grand aunt to Drew Barrymore)
Only two Male names show up in the top 20.  Wilbur and Orville.  Looks like technological breakthrough can impact name popularity!
